Python programs I am coding to practice.

**Be careful :**  password meter and generator are toys, so please be careful.

### List of items and purpose

 - `pwdgenerator.py`: Original design to be a passwords generator, it
 actually randomly chooses two words (a descriptive and a noun), then it prints
 the selection to the standard output. Finally, the program creates a sort of leet
 string usable as a password. The words used are stored in a JSON file (see next
 point).
 - `words.json` : Store words in two categories, descriptive ones and nouns
 - `leet.py` : Module to deal with a sort of leet (1337) language
 - `pwdmeter.py`: Compute the strength of a password (incomplete)
 - `input2json.py` : _Not yet usable!_ Transform data from standard input and store it to JSON
 - More fun to come...
