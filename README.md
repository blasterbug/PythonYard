### List of items and purpose

 - `password-generator.py`: Original design to be a passwords generator, it
 actually randomly choose two words (a descriptive and a noum), then it prints
 the selection to the standard output. the words are stored in a JSON file.
 - `words.json` : Store words in two categories, descriptive ones and noums.
