Python programs I am coding to practice.

**Be careful :**  password meter and generator are toys, so please be careful.

### List of items and purpose

 - `pwdgenerator.py`: Original design to be a passwords generator, it
 actually randomly choose two words (a descriptive and a noum), then it prints
 the selection to the standard output. Finally, the program create a sort of leet
 string usable as a password. The words used are stored in a JSON file (see next
 point).
 - `words.json` : Store words in two categories, descriptive ones and noums.
 - `leet.py` : Module to play with a sort of leet (1337) language.
 - `pwdmeter.py`: Compute the strength of a password
 - `input2json.py` : Read data from standard input and store it to a JSON file. __Not yet usable!__ 
 - More fun to come...
